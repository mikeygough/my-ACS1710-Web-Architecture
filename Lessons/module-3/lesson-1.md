Companies of all types collect and utilize data on their users. This can range from medical data at a hospital, transport data from a public transit organization, or personalized profile data from a tech company.

This data can be leveraged across platforms and easily shared using an **Application Programming Interface** **(API)**. Developers granted an API permission can tap into another company's data for their own application!
