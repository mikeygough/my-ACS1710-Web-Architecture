# Quiz 2

SWAPI is the Star Wars API. It provides information about 
all of the characters, worlds, vehicles, and movies in the 
Star Wars universe. 

Your goal is to make a Flask app that serves up information 
from SWAPI. 

Take a look here: https://swapi.py4e.com

Read the documentation and test out the API. 

The base URL is: https://swapi.py4e.com/api/

SWAPI supports these endpoints: 

- https://swapi.py4e.com/api/people
- https://swapi.py4e.com/api/planets
- https://swapi.py4e.com/api/vehicles
- https://swapi.py4e.com/api/spaceships
- https://swapi.py4e.com/api/films
- https://swapi.py4e.com/api/species

Following any of these end points with an id will return 
a record from the database. For example: 

https://swapi.py4e.com/api/people/1 

Returns data about Luke Sky Walker

https://swapi.py4e.com/api/planets/3

Returns data for Yavin IV

https://swapi.py4e.com/api/films/4

Returns data for the The Phantom Menace

You need to form your query like this: 

https://swapi.py4e.com/api/<category>/<id>

Where category and id come from your form!

## Challenge 1

Display the character data from SWAPI. You'll need to include an
input that allows us to input the id of a character. Your code 
will request the data from the API and display it on the page. 

For any character you should display: 

- name 
- height
- mass
- hair_color
- eye_color

## Stretch Challenge

Style your work. This is open ended put as much time into this 
as you like. 

Style the form elements and the the output data. 

## Error Checking for bad requests

Some of the ids are missing or out of bounds. 
For example people/17 doesn't exist. Solve this challenge 
by checking for errors and displaying a message when there 
is a problem.

## Stretch Challenge 

The homeworld property is a URL to the homeworl at the SWAPI. Make another request and get the homeworld data and display the name of the hoemworld. 

## Displaying Lists

Every character has a films property that is a list of the films they appeared in. This list is a list of URLs to those films on SWAPI. Loop over this list, make a request to get the data for each 	film and display the name of each film.
